# Predicting-the-Survival-of-Titanic-Passengers-Using-Machine-Learning
This project dives into the vast dataset detailing information about Titanic passengers, including crucial details like age, gender, class, whether they survived or not, ticket information, cabin allocation, fare paid, and the port they embarked from. 

By using modern data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover trends and connections that might explain why some people made it out alive while others didn't. We'll sift through these details to see if factors like age, gender, class, and familial relationships, such as siblings, played a role in survival chances.

## Overview
- The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for machine learning and predictive modeling tasks.
- The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.
